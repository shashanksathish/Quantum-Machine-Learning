    "An additional power of quantum is that we can entangle two particles or pieces of information together such that having the knowledge of one piece will provide us with knowledge about the other. There are different ways in which we can generate entanglement using quantum gates, but the one requirement is that we utilize two-qubit gates. These gates are actually difficult to implement physically and therefore, remain a limitation of near-term quantum computing. Thus, it is important that we find ways to create short depth circuits that use less two-qubit gates. \n",

Below is not a solution as this is very hard to generate without the help of a classical algorithm to find our optimal rotation angles to do this. This is actually a place where machine learning can help quantum! Have a go in playing around with the angles below and introduce new gates! "
